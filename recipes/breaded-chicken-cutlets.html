        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you’re starting from 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally with a sharp knife.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generously season both sides of the chicken cutlets with salt and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up the chicken next to three large deep plates or shallow bowls. I like to work in order from left to right: spread add ½ cup all-purpose flour in the first bowl. Beat 2 eggs in the second bowl. Finally, stir together 1 cup breadcrumbs, ½ cup grated parmesan, and 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning in the third. Set up an empty plate or tray for the breaded cutlets on the right.
            </li>
            <li>
                Working one at a time, place a chicken cutlet in the bowl of flour and coat both sides, shaking off the excess. Then transfer the cutlet to the bowl of beaten eggs and coat both sides, letting the excess runoff. Set the cutlet in the breadcrumbs and coat both sides, gently pressing the breadcrumbs onto the cutlet so they stick. Set the breaded cutlet aside on the reserved plate. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. Set the cutlets aside for 10 minutes or so to allow the breading to stick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a wire rack over a sheet pan next to your stove. In a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add enough oil to cover your skillet (I used ¼ cup). Heat until it’s shimmering but not smoking. You can test if the oil is ready by dropping in a few breadcrumbs. If they start sizzling gently, the oil is ready. If they sizzle loudly and brown very quickly, lower the heat slightly. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooking in batches to avoid crowding the pan, carefully add 1 or 2 cutlets into the pan. To avoid splattering the hot oil, use tongs to lay each cutlet down starting with one tip by the edge of the pan nearest you and carefully laying it away from you towards the furthest edge of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the cutlets to the wire rack to drain and repeat with the remaining cutlets, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil as needed between batches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle on flaky sea salt to finish (if using.) Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over the cutlets.
            </li>
        </ol>
